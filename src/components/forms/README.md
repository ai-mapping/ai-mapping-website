# Form Components (Placeholder)

This directory is a placeholder for form components. In this template version, we've removed actual form implementations for simplicity. In a real project, you might want to implement forms using:

- React Hook Form
- Formik
- Zod validation
- Your preferred form library

The template has been configured to work without forms, so this directory is kept for structural consistency only.
