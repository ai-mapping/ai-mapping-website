# Email Service (Placeholder)

This directory is a placeholder for email service functionality. In this template version, we've removed actual email sending implementations for simplicity. 

In a real project, you might implement email functionality using:
- SendGrid
- Mailchimp
- Amazon SES
- Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)
- Other email service providers

The template has been configured to work without email functionality, so this directory is kept for structural consistency only.
