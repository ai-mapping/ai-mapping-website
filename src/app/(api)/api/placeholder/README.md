# API Routes (Placeholder)

This directory is a placeholder for API route implementations. In this template version, we've removed actual API functionality for simplicity.

In a real project, you might implement Next.js API routes for:
- Form submissions
- Authentication
- Data fetching
- Webhook handling
- And more

The template has been configured to work without API routes, so this directory is kept for structural consistency only.
